# Experimental Fcitx5 addon

UniLume now has an optional Fcitx5 input-method addon. It is an experimental
MVP, not a production-ready package.

## Build

Install CMake, pkg-config, a C++23 compiler, and Fcitx5 core development files.
On Debian-family systems the Fcitx dependency is:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libfcitx5core-dev pkg-config
```

Build and install into a disposable prefix:

```sh
PREFIX="$(mktemp -d)"

cmake -S . -B build/fcitx5 \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DUNILUME_BUILD_FCITX5_ADDON=ON \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$PREFIX"
cmake --build build/fcitx5 --parallel 2
cmake --install build/fcitx5
```

The prefix contains:

```text
lib/fcitx5/unilume.so
share/fcitx5/addon/unilume.conf
share/fcitx5/inputmethod/unilume.conf
```

With the option left `OFF`, normal core builds do not require Fcitx5. With the
option `ON`, configure fails clearly if the development package is missing.

For a user installation, choose a prefix recognized by that Fcitx5 package,
reload/restart Fcitx5, and add UniLume through `fcitx5-configtool`. Distribution
paths differ, so packaging must set the final prefix explicitly.

## Direct-commit behavior

Each Fcitx input context owns an independent engine/controller state. Ordinary
text is committed immediately. When Telex changes text already committed,
the backend requests the minimum surrounding-text deletion and commits the
replacement in the same synchronous controller transaction. Cursor movement,
focus changes, reset events, and unhandled Backspace clear composition state.

An input context with usable surrounding-text capability on its first key
uses direct commit with no client preedit and therefore no underline. A
context without that capability uses the safe preedit fallback for its entire
lifespan. Frontends may display that client preedit with an underline. The
addon never promotes a live preedit context into direct mode,
because a frontend may still be applying an asynchronous preedit update.

## Safety fallback

Replacement requires the Fcitx `SurroundingText` capability plus either text
committed by the current state or a valid, unselected surrounding-text cursor
with enough characters. If the condition is not trustworthy, UniLume resets
composition and commits the triggering raw key instead of guessing a deletion.

This policy prefers a visible uncomposed key over duplicate or missing text.
It does not synthesize Backspace, sleep, retry indefinitely, use a socket
daemon, or provide a uinput fallback.

Fcitx delete/commit methods are synchronous requests on its event thread and
do not acknowledge application-side mutation. See
[real-application-validation.md](real-application-validation.md) for the
tested frontend matrix and the reason Firefox remains on fallback.

## Verification status

Automated:

- addon compilation and dynamic linking with Fcitx5 5.1.12 headers/runtime;
- install into a temporary prefix and metadata/factory-symbol checks;
- controller tests for immediate, delayed, stale, duplicate, reordered,
  dropped, failure, reset, burst, and sanitizer profiles.

Controlled desktop validation has covered xterm, KWrite, Zenity, VSCode,
Chrome, and Firefox ESR on KDE/X11. Direct zero-preedit was observed in the
tested Qt and GTK contexts; XIM and browser/Electron contexts used fallback.
This is still a limited environment matrix, not a production-readiness claim.

No GUI configuration, VNI/VIQR selection, macros, legacy charset output,
uinput, distro package, or system-wide Wayland protocol integration is
provided yet. Telex/UTF-8 is the only exposed addon mode.
